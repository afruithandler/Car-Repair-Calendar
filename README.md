# Car-Repair-Calendar
The goal of this repository is to make an easy to understand and visually appealing mile calendar that can be put into someones car to tell them when they need to perform routine maintenance and repairs.

I would like to get help on making the excel sheet user friendly as well as add a printable pdf that can be printed and placed in someones car. This could be checked off for every visit.  I perhaps want to add a feature that tells the user the best milage to go to the mechanic so that they can saved money by getting several repairs and checks at once.
